# First Game From Scratch

This is a volunteer project for RND4Impact (https://www.rnd4impact.com/).

In this project, I programmed a game from scratch in C++ by following this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Ej6SUky135IAAR3PFCFyiVwanauRqj3). This project was done without using any external libraries or engines. It goes through:
- creating a Windows graphical application
- creating the game lifcycle loop (input, simulation, render)
- rendering
- memory management
- refactoring modules such as platform independent logic
- controlling interactions with input

This project is not in a finished or polished state and can still use many improvements. Example improvement include:
- add support for more key strokes
- more rendering shapes
- more interesting game logic

The current game window looks like the following:
